# Flip Learning



## What is flip-learning?

- The word "flip" in flip-learning means "turn over," which means "education that reverses existing teaching methods."

  This is not a traditional way of teaching in the classroom and doing homework at home, but rather a way of providing online lecture videos before class and solving problems that students have not solved before class or engaging in more advanced learning activities.

- The most effective way is to do what you can do alone, and to do activities that you can do together when you're all together.

## feature of flip-learning

- Flip learning has the following feature:
  - First, let the passive learner of the instructor-led class become the active learner of the class.
  - Second, a teacher who is a supervisor or knowledge communicator acts as a facilitator to help students learn. (In flip learning, the role of a teacher should be a facilitator.)
  - Third, we promote classes by utilizing technology such as online videos.
  - Fourth, the time for traditional classroom classes and homework changes. (Homework no longer needs to be done, and academic performance improves. )

## flip-learning effect

- Depending on the preceding features, flip learning can have the following effects:
  - the improvement of students academic performance
  - Positive influences on motivation, self-respect, learning attitude, etc.





Previously, flip-learning problems included insufficient infrastructure for flip-learning, preparation and trust, and the importance of pre-preparation, but today's online training with Corona 19 can make solving problems much easier.
